# ü§ù How to Contribute to the Consciousness Alignment Protocol (CAP)

Welcome.

You are not just contributing to a software project.  
You are helping build the **first global cognitive infrastructure** ‚Äî a system that detects and corrects the deepest mismatch in human history: between our biology and our environment.

This is open-source.  
This is open-science.  
This is open-future.

We invite you to build it with us.

## üåç Who Can Contribute?

Everyone.

We welcome contributions from:
- **Software developers** (mobile, AI, backend, privacy)
- **Neuroscientists & psychologists** (cognitive modeling, validation)
- **Evolutionary biologists** (mismatch theory, human adaptation)
- **Urban planners & public health experts** (spatial analytics, policy)
- **Ethicists & legal scholars** (data governance, human rights)
- **Designers** (UX, behavioral nudges, accessibility)
- **Translators** (make CAP globally accessible)
- **Citizen scientists** (field testing, real-world feedback)

No contribution is too small.  
No voice is too quiet.
